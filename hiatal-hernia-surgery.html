              A hernia can be simply described as a bulge or an out-pouching of
              body contents into an area outside their normal positions. They
              can happen anywhere in the body although the trunk is the most
              commonly involved region. Our center,
              <strong> Chennai Hernia Center</strong> has experts well versed in

              <p>
                A hiatal hernia is a special type of hernia that occurs when
                part of the stomach is pushed up into the chest through an
                opening in the large muscle (the diaphragm) that separates the
                stomach and the lungs.
                <strong> This opening called the hiatus </strong>is how the food
                pipe (esophagus) connects to the stomach, thus leading to the
                name hiatal hernia. There are two types of hiatal hernia-
                sliding and rolling hernias:

              <strong> Sliding hernia: </strong>This type is most common and may
              show mild symptoms or no symptoms even. Here, the food pipe and
              stomach together move up through the hiatus into the chest, or
              rather, they “slide up” smoothly together.
              <strong> These hernias might have symptoms on and off </strong
              >because the hernia might slide back down from time to time.

            <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
              <strong> Rolling hernia:</strong> Although less common, these are
              <strong> more dangerous than the other type.</strong> In this type
              of hiatal hernia;
              <strong> the esophagus is not shifted from its position </strong>
              but a part of the stomach slides up through the hiatus by
              squeezing through the side of the esophagus. Since this is an
              <strong>
                extremely small gap, the hernia can get stuck there and cause
                complications.</strong

          How do I know if I have a hiatal hernia?
        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            <strong>
              Many people with a hiatal hernia often have no symptoms
            </strong>
            and may not realise it even exists! Out of the symptoms that can
            manifest, heartburn is the most common one. This is because the acid
            that is produced in the stomach and stays there can flow upward into
            the esophagus due to the improper movement of the hernia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the esophagus is not built to withstand the effects of acid
            like the stomach, it can lead to symptoms of acid reflux like
            heartburn, bloating, belching, difficulty swallowing, nausea etc. If
            this continues for a long time, longstanding acid reflux symptoms
            like persistent cough, sore throat, bad breath, recurrent chest pain
            and dental issues can also happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most serious symptom is when a rolling hernia gets stuck with
            its <strong>blood supply cut off (“strangulated”)</strong> leading
            to severe pain in the chest or abdomen, loss of defecation or
            flatulence, nausea, vomiting with a rapid decrease of physical
            wellness (as the patient goes into “shock”). This is a medical
            emergency and requires immediate intervention.

          Why do hiatal hernias occur?
        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            There are
            <strong> no specific reasons for their occurrence.</strong>
            Sometimes, people are born with a bigger hiatus than normal;
            sometimes the diaphragm loosens as we age leading to a widening of
            the gap. In some people, body changes that put some stress on the
            diaphragm like obesity and pregnancy can also lead to hiatal
            hernias. Previous injury to the area or history of diaphragmatic or
            upper gastrointestinal surgery have also been implicated in their
            formation. In very rare cases,
            <strong> some babies are born with diaphragmatic hernias.</strong>
          </p>
          <h5>I have severe hearth5urn! Could it be a hiatal hernia?</h5>
          <p>
            Heartburn is a symptom of hiatal hernias but not exclusive to it. If
            you suffer from severe heartburn, it is best to seek medical
            attention. A hiatus hernia cannot be diagnosed solely on the basis
            of symptoms and alone.
            <strong>
              At our center, Dr. Rengan will carefully consider your symptoms,
              do a physical examination and perform tests in order to reach the
              correct diagnosis.</strong

            Some tests that can be done to diagnose a hiatal hernia are :

            with regular review checkups. For very mild cases of heartburn, a
            trial of acid reflux treatment with medicines can be given. However,
            if the symptoms are recurrent, if there have been gross pathological
            changes like ulceration or thinning of the affected area, or if the
            hernia seems at risk of strangulation; hiatal hernia surgery will be
            recommended to you. Since recurrent acid reflux carries with it a
            risk of esophageal cancer and since a strangulated hernia can cause
            life threatening complications, both of these are scenarios that are
            best treated preemptively.

          What Hiatal Hernia Surgery Will Be Done? Is It Going to Leave Me

        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            The surgeries done to treat hiatal hernias can be open surgery or
            <a href="laparoscopic-hernia-surgery.html">
              laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery.
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic aim of the surgery is to push back your stomach to its
            original position, tighten the diaphragm so that the hernia cannot
            recur and also replicate the valve between the food pipe and the
            stomach so that reflux cannot recur.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Laparoscopic surgery is now the most commonly used method</strong
            >
            in which multiple small incisions are made in the area in order to
            pass some thin devices through. These devices can be used to
            visualize the area and manipulate the organs and tissue to perform
            the required reparations. The devices are then removed and the
            incisions are sown up with minimal blood loss.
            <strong>
              While laparoscopic surgeries are usually more time-consuming for
              the surgeon, they provide the benefits of quicker recovery and
              less complications for the patient. </strong
            >However, this type of surgery is not performed for massive defects
            or emergencies because it can lead to poor results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open surgery is the traditional model of surgery where a large
            incision is made in order to reach in and perform the repair. This
            is usually the option of choice for large defects and emergencies
            and usually requires a longer stay than key-hole surgery. Sometimes,
            a tube will have to be left in after the surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both types of surgery are done under general anesthesia and may only
            require admission for a couple of days depending on your other
            medical factors.

              >Dr. Rengan and all his associates are experienced and familiar
              with both types of surgery. At our center, we will have a detailed
              discussion with you where we figure out the best type of surgery
              for you.</strong
            >
            Once the decision for surgery has been made, further pre-operative
            discussions will be held to further evaluate your personal and
            physical condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although rest is advised post-operatively, you will not be bedridden
            at all. In fact, we encourage movement as soon as you are
            comfortable.
            <strong>
              Our team at Chennai Hernia Center will give you the correct advice
              and instructions on how to take care of yourself after the
              surgery.</strong
            >
            We will provide detailed instructions and medicines for pain relief,
            wound care, diet and physical exercise after the surgery. We will
            schedule review sessions with you even after healing so that you can
            be informed on what other diet & lifestyle changes you can make in
            order to prevent a recurrence or further complications.
