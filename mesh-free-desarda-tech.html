              A hernia can be simply called an abnormal bulge or an out-pouching
              in the body. Usually, they are the organs or tissues of the
              abdomen bulging out from their normal location through a
              weakness/defect in the muscle or tissues surrounding it. Hernias
              are quite common and can be of numerous kinds, the most common
              being inguinal (groin) hernias. Here, at Chennai Hernia Center, we
              specialize in treating many different kinds of hernias. Our chief
              consultant, Dr. Rengan has more than 30 years of experience in

          What is Mesh Free Desarda Technique ?
        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            Mesh-free Desarda technique is a revolutionary type of hernia repair
            surgery which does not use any foreign material (eg. mesh) to
            provide reinforcement at the site of weakness.
          </p>
          <h3>
            How exactly is Mesh-free Desarda Repair different from regular
            hernia repair Surgery?
          </h3>
          <p>
            To understand this better, a brief overview of one of the most
            popular regular hernia repair techniques (called the Lichtenstein
            technique) is given below:
          </p>
          <p>
            “In the Lichtenstein technique, an open incision is made at the site
            of hernia and repair is carried out by reinforcing the site of the
            weakness by covering it with a mesh rather than just sewing the
            edges of the weakness together.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The laparoscopic approach to hernia surgery also follows the same
            technique, but uses instrument tubes through multiple small
            incisions to access and correct the hernia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main difference between Mesh-free Desarda repair and other types
            of inguinal hernia repair surgery from a purely technical standpoint
            is that this
            <strong>
              new form of repair does not involve a foreign body (mesh) being
              placed in the body. Instead, it utilises one of the body’s own
              tissues to achieve the goals of surgical reinforcement.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Desarda technique, the opening up of the weakness, the
            incisions, and the excision of hernia sac are all similar to that of
            the older open techniques. However, when it comes to reinforcing the
            weakness of the hernia wall, a unique approach takes place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The surgeon cuts out a flap from a muscle close to the area called
            the external oblique aponeurosis. This flap is then manipulated and
            stitched in such a way that the defect is enveloped by it at the
            front and back. This is unique because now, because of the added
            reinforcement, the muscle will maintain tension adequately during
            physical activities like coughing or lifting objects. As the muscle
            flap also continues to remain attached to its main body, it is a
            healthy piece of living tissue that will not cause any side effects
            or untoward complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is in contrast to mesh repairs which involve placing a foreign
            body – a mesh made of non-degradable material – at the site for
            reinforcement.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Chennai Hernia Center, both
            <strong> Dr. Rengan and Dr. Vinayak </strong> are experienced hernia
            surgeons in many types of inguinal hernia repair surgery, including
            the Desarda Technique.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">Are meshes bad?</h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            <strong
              >No meshes are not bad. Mesh still remains the gold standard in
              hernia surgery. </strong
            >However we offer Desarda mesh-free technique to our patients who
            don’t want a mesh. Since the beginning of hernia surgery’s long
            history, one of the most common issues faced by surgeons was the
            high rate of recurrence in hernias. It was then, after a lot of
            trial and error, that the idea of placing a mesh over the repair
            site for reinforcement was introduced. The results were exceptional
            and soon, the use of non-mesh repairs was almost phased out.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are certain complications associated with meshes in certain
            groups of patients. Only in them, we would electively advise a
            mesh=free hernia surgery. One of the examples is a strangulated
            hernia where meshes can get infected.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          I have heard there are other Mesh-free techniques as well. Why are
          they not preferred?
        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            As mentioned earlier, the first inguinal hernia repair surgeries
            were mesh-free techniques (simply because surgical meshes hadn’t
            even been invented!). Nevertheless, these techniques pioneered by
            Bassini and then furthered by Shouldice paved the way for hernia
            repair.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the 1960s, with Lichtenstein’s introduction of hernia repair with
            a mesh, these techniques fell out of popularity and were reserved
            for use only in certain exceptional cases. It was after a few more
            decades, in 1983, that Dr. Mohan Desarda came up with a new and
            efficient mesh-free technique – one that can be considered on par
            with the current mesh or laparoscopic surgeries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, a good question to ask any surgeon when being told of the
            need for surgery is the NAME of the surgery or the technique. IF a
            mesh-free technique is to be used, make sure to ask for the Desarda
            repair.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, hernia repair is an operation with various
            techniques for a common problem. There is still no definitive answer
            in the medical field as to which is the best hernia surgery. Even
            older techniques still have to be performed in certain scenarios.
            This is why a heart-to-heart conversation with your doctor is
            necessary before embarking on surgical treatment. At Chennai Hernia
            Center, our doctors will provide you detailed information on what
            surgery is being preferred, what technique can be used and WHY. Not
            only will your physical or medical condition be kept in mind before
            prescribing or deciding on the type of surgery, your personal
            opinion will also be sought.
          </p>

              >We believe it is important that patients understand their body
