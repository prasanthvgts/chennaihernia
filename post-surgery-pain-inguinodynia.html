              A combination of the words “inguinal”, meaning groin, and “-dynia”
              that refers to pain, inguinodynia can simply be described as groin
              pain.

                Postoperative inguinodynia is a situation in which groin pain

              It is most commonly noted after hernia repair surgeries, simply

                Since pain is a subjective feeling, it has been difficult to
                accurately figure out the incidence of postoperative
                inguinodynia. Early studies put it at 19% of operations but
                recent larger and more extensive studies have shown an incidence
                of around 10% for laparoscopic surgeries. (Eklund et al, 2010)

            Nevertheless, this is an issue that experienced surgeons have known
            about and are on the lookout for.
            <strong>
              Here at Chennai Hernia Centre, Dr. Rengan has more than 30 years
              of experience in this field and is well equipped not just to treat
              your hernia, but also any unexpected complications that can arise
              from it.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <h5>
            I don’t like these odds. Can I just choose not to have my hernia
            operated on?
          </h5>
          <p>
            This is a valid question and we understand how distressing it is to
            hear of the possibility of pain even after a surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              To start with, 10-20% of hernia surgeries is a small enough number
              that most patients remain unaffected and go on to lead comfortable
              postoperative lives.</strong
            >
            In fact, even of the small percentage that complain of pain, an even
            smaller group describes it as anything but mild.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, and this is the most important reason, is that when a
            decision to operate on a hernia has been made, even on a
            non-emergency basis, there is usually a very good reason for it.
            What this means is that if certain risk factors are being met or
            fast approaching, hernia surgery is an uncompromisable decision for
            a patient’s life and long-term health. Remember that the only
            definitive treatment for hernias is surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, over the last couple of decades, surgeons have learnt more
            and more about what the causes of postoperative inguinodynia are.
            This puts them at a unique advantage of not just treating the
            problem AFTER it occurs, but even before. Even at the initial hernia
            repair, surgeons have an eye out for any potential risks or body
            factors that could put the patient at risk of developing
            inguinodynia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping all this in mind, it is best that patients not shy away from
            an essential surgery because of the fear of complications.
            <strong>
              Nevertheless, we pride on keeping a patient-first approach in our
              clinic and of course, no patient must be pressured to undergo a
              surgery without being fully comfortable with the idea.</strong
            >
            In fact, if your hernia is mild enough, we will consider deferring
            surgery for as long as possible as well.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          What are these reasons for Postoperative Inguinodynia?
        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            There are a number of reasons for postoperative inguinodynia. Some
            of these are related directly to problems from the operation like if
            the mesh or sutures are placed poorly, or if the spermatic cord in
            the region has been affected.
            <strong>
              These can cause pain by themselves or by impinging on a
              nerve.</strong
            >
            Nerves can also be affected by an excessive scarring response by the
            patient’s body.
            <strong>
              All this makes nerve injury (neuropathy) the most common basis for
              pain in postoperative inguinodynia.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Post-op infection of the wound or mesh, or fistulization/sinus
            formation also occurs in certain patients. There are also unrelated
            medical conditions causing inguinodynia that could be mistaken for a
            postoperative cause like gynecological problems or irritable bowel
            syndrome.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          How can postoperative inguinodynia be treated?
        </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="700">
          <p>
            When neuropathy occurs from the inflammation of the nerve in the
            area,<strong>
              it usually resolves itself in a couple of months.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            To figure out the area affected by pain or the involved nerve, we
            will perform dermato-sensory mapping. Using just a simple blunt
            stimulator and color markers can help determine which neural skin
            areas were involved. This will be repeated postoperatively to check
            for resolution of pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            For immediate pain control, over-the-counter pain medications might
            just be enough.
            <strong>
              If that is inadequate, stronger oral or injectable treatment can
              be prescribed.</strong
            >
            Injectable anesthetic agents or steroids do help with maintenance of
            pain-relief in many cases.
            <strong>
              When the anesthetic is directed onto the nerve, that procedure is
              called a nerve block.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, it’s only in rare cases that re-operation is necessary to
            look over and/or remove the mesh and the offending nerves for
            resolution of the pain. Reoperation can be done in a key-hole
            approach as well but not in all cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> The removal of nerves is called a neurectomy.</strong>
            Three main sensory nerves of the groin called the ilioinguinal,
            iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves have to be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other causes of pain like infection or misplacement have to be
            evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and may exist independently or in
            concomitance with the nerve issues. Furthermore, it is important to
            rule out a possibly new or previously undiagnosed condition as being
            the cause of this issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Here at Chennai Hernia Center, Dr. Rengan and his associates have
              had long and varied exposures to postoperative
              inguinodynia.</strong
            >
            They are well aware of the different causes of this condition and
            know how to prevent and if necessary, treat it.
